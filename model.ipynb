    "##### One big challenge of the telecommunications sector is customer churn when customers decide to discontinue their services due to dissatisfaction or unfulfilled needs. For SyriaTel, where churn occurs mostly due to demographic factors, usage patterns, service interaction, and even payment history, it is thus important to understand these so as to formulate methodologies of improving customer satisfaction and retention. By identifying key indicators of churn, SyriaTel will have the necessary information to take the needed measures to resolve the problems before they cause loss of customers."
